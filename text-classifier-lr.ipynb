NT-proBNP was measured in 1,034 patients referred for elective coronary angiography. In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, the hazard ratio for death from any cause for patients with NT-proBNP levels in the fourth quartile as compared with those in the first quartile was 2.4 (95% CI 1.5-4.0). NT-proBNP provides prognostic information on all-cause mortality independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors and left ventricular dysfunction.   \n",
              "1  Background: Usually, the two-stage Masquelet induced-membrane technique for extremity reconstruction begins with a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement spacer-driven membrane, followed by an autologous cancellous bone graft implanted into the membrane cavity to promote healing of large bone defects. In exceptional cases, spacers made of polypropylene disposable syringes were successfully used instead of the usual PMMA spacers because of a PMMA cement shortage caused by a lack of resources. However, this approach lacks clinical evidence and requires experimental validation before being recommended as an alternative to the conventional technique.Questions/purposes: To (1) develop and (2) validate a critical-sized femoral defect model in rats for two stages of the Masquelet technique and to (3) compare the biological and bone healing properties of polypropylene-induced membranes and PMMA-induced membranes in this model.Methods: Fifty male Sprague Dawley rats aged 8 weeks old received a 6-mm femur defect, which was stabilized with an external fixator that was converted into an internal device. In the development phase, the defect was filled with PMMA in 16 rats to determine the most favorable timing for bone grafting. Two rats were excluded since they died of anesthetic complications. The other 14 were successively euthanized after 2 weeks (n = 3), 4 weeks (n = 4), 6 weeks (n = 4), and 8 weeks (n = 3) for induced membrane analyses. In the validation phase, 12 rats underwent both stages of the procedure using a PMMA spacer and were randomly assigned to two groups, whether the induced membrane was preserved or removed before grafting. To address our final objective, we implanted either polypropylene or PMMA spacers into the defect (Masquelet technique Stage 1; n = 11 rats per group) for the period established by the development phase. In each group, 6 of 11 rats were euthanized to compare the biological properties of polypropylene-induced membranes and PMMA-induced membranes using histological qualitative analysis, semiquantitative assessment of the bone morphogenic protein-2 content by immunostaining, and qualitative assessment of the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC; CD31-, CD45-, CD90+, and CD73+ phenotypes) content by flow cytometry. Quantitative measurements from serum bone turnover markers were also performed. The five remaining rats of each group were used for Masquelet technique Stage 2, in which rat bone allografts were implanted in the induced membrane cavity after the polypropylene or PMMA spacers were removed. These rats recovered for 10 weeks before being euthanized for microCT quantitative measurements and bone histology qualitative assessment to evaluate and compare the extent of bone regeneration between groups.Results: Induced membrane analyses together with serum bone turnover measurements indicated that a 4-week interval time between stages was the most favorable. Removal of the induced membrane before grafting led to almost constant early implant failures with poor bone formation. Four-week-old rats with polypropylene-triggered induced membranes displayed similar histologic organization as rats with PMMA-driven induced membranes, without any difference in the cell density of the extracellular matrix (4933 ? 916 cells per mm2 for polypropylene versus 4923 ? 1284 cells per mm2 for PMMA; p = 0.98). Induced membrane-derived MSCs were found in both groups with no difference (4 of 5 with polypropylene versus 3 of 3 with PMMA; p > 0.99). Induced membrane bone morphogenic protein-2 immunolabeling and serum bone turnover marker levels were comparable between the polypropylene and PMMA groups. MicroCT analysis found that bone regeneration in the polypropylene group seemed comparable with that in the PMMA group (29 ? 26 mm3 for polypropylene versus 24 ? 18 mm3 for PMMA; p > 0.99). Finally, qualitative histological assessment revealed a satisfactory endochondral ossification maturation in both groups.Conclusion: Using a critical-sized femoral defect model in rats, we demonstrated that polypropylene spacers could induce membrane encapsulation with histologic characteristics and bone regenerative capacities that seem like those of PMMA spacers.Clinical Relevance: In a same bone site, polymers with close physical properties seem to lead to similar foreign body reactions and induce encapsulating membranes with comparable bone healing properties. Polypropylene spacers made from disposable syringes could be a valuable alternative to PMMA. These results support the possibility of a cementless Masquelet technique in cases of PMMA shortage caused by a lack of resources.   \n",

However, the mechanism by which Oryeongsan (ORS) improves the impaired body fluid and salt metabolism is not clearly defined. The present study was performed to define the role of the cardiorenal humoral system in the ORS-induced changes in blood pressure and renal function in hypertension. Experiments were performed in normotensive and two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats. Changes in the fluid and salt balance were measured in rats individually housed in metabolic cages. Changes in the systemic and local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and cardiac natriuretic peptide hormone system (NPS) were evaluated. ORS water extract was administered by oral gavage (100 mg/kg daily) for 3 weeks. ORS induced diuresis and natriuresis along with an increase in glomerular filtration rate and downregulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) and aquaporin 2 expression in the renal cortex and medulla, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with ORS significantly decreased systolic blood pressure with contraction of body sodium and water accumulation in hypertensive rats. ORS-induced changes were accompanied by modulation of the RAS and NPS, downregulation of the systemic RAS and cardiorenal expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor, and upregulation of the plasma ANP concentration and cardiorenal expression of ANP, ACE2, Mas receptor, and AT2 receptor. These findings indicate that ORS induces beneficial effects on the high blood pressure through modulation of the RAS and NPS of the cardiorenal system, suppression of the prohypertensive ACE-AT1 receptor pathway and NHE3, accentuation of the antihypertensive ACE2-Mas axis/AT2 receptor pathway in the kidney, suppression of the systemic RAS, and elevation of the plasma ANP levels and its synthesis in the heart. The present study provides a biological basis for the use of ORS in the treatment of impaired volume and pressure homeostasis. Copyright ? 2022 You Mee Ahn et al.   \n",

Changes in blood volume and plasma conductivity (PC) during HD can be modelled by feedback technology, but their effects on sodium homeostasis are not widely studied., METHODS: This randomized crossover study compared PC and ionic mass balance (IMB) as surrogate markers of sodium balance between standard HD [dialysate conductivity (DC) 14.0 mS/cm], sodium profiling (DC 15.0-->14.0 mS/cm), blood volume (BV)-controlled and PC-controlled feedback (target: post-HD PC: 14.0 mS/cm) in 10 HD patients with frequent hypotension., RESULTS: 440 treatments were studied. Pre-dialytic PC was significantly higher during SP (14.4+/-0.2 mS/cm) compared to standard HD (14.2+/-0.3 mS/cm), and was not different between the other manoeuvres: PC-controlled (14.1+/-0.3 mS/cm), and BV-controlled feedback (14.2+/-0.2 mS/cm). Except for the first treatment, during which IMB was lower during the sodium profile, IMB did not differ significantly between the various manoeuvres and was strongly dependent upon ultrafiltration volume and the difference between pre-dialytic PC and DC. Symptomatic hypotensive episodes occurred least frequently during BV-controlled feedback (8%) compared to the other manoeuvres (standard HD, 16%; sodium profile, 14%; PC-controlled feedback, 17%), but differences were not significant. Inter-dialytic weight gain and pre-dialytic systolic blood pressure did not differ., CONCLUSIONS: Pre-dialytic PC increased during the sodium profile, and did not differ between BV- or PC-controlled feedback compared to standard HD. Thus, it appears that both BV- and PC-controlled feedback can be safely prescribed without substantial salt- and water-loading, at least in the short term. Analysis of IMB is useful to assess differences in sodium balance between single treatment sessions but appears of less value in a steady-state situation.   \n",

Glutamate transporters and the glutamate-glutamine cycle play crucial roles in the development of seizures. In the present study, the correlation of epilepsy with glutamate transporters and enzymes was investigated. Herein, male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups (six animals/group); 35 mg/kg pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) was used to induce a kindling model of epilepsy. Once the kindling model was established, animals were treated for 15 days with either valproic acid (VPA, 350 mg/kg) or ceftriaxone (CEF, 200 mg/kg) in addition to the control group receiving saline. After treatment, electrocorticography (ECoG) was performed to record the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex. The glutamate reuptake time (T80) was also determined in situ using an in vivo voltammetry. The expression levels of glutamate transporters and enzymes in the M1 and CA3 areas of the brain were determined using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ECoG measurements showed that the mean spike number of the PTZ + VPA and PTZ + CEF groups was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of the PTZ group. Compared with the PTZ group, VPA or CEF treatment decreased the glutamate reuptake time (T80). The expression levels of EAAC1, GLT-1, GLAST, glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutaminase were increased in the PTZ group. Treatment with VPA or CEF enhanced the expression levels of GLT-1, GLAST, EAAC1, and GS, whereas the glutaminase expression level was reduced. The current results suggest that VPA or CEF decreases seizure activity by increasing glutamate reuptake by upregulating GLT-1 and GLAST expression, implying a possible mechanism for treating epilepsy. Also, we have suggested a novel mechanism for the antiepileptic activity of VPA via decreasing glutaminase expression levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the glutamate reuptake time in situ during the seizure (i.e., real-time measurement).Copyright ? 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.   \n",

              "1  the masquelet technique: can disposable polypropylene syringes be an alternative to standard pmma spacers? a rat bone defect model. background: usually, the two-stage masquelet induced-membrane technique for extremity reconstruction begins with a polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) cement spacer-driven membrane, followed by an autologous cancellous bone graft implanted into the membrane cavity to promote healing of large bone defects. in exceptional cases, spacers made of polypropylene disposable syringes were successfully used instead of the usual pmma spacers because of a pmma cement shortage caused by a lack of resources. however, this approach lacks clinical evidence and requires experimental validation before being recommended as an alternative to the conventional technique.questions/purposes: to (1) develop and (2) validate a critical-sized femoral defect model in rats for two stages of the masquelet technique and to (3) compare the biological and bone healing properties of polypropylene-induced membranes and pmma-induced membranes in this model.methods: fifty male sprague dawley rats aged 8 weeks old received a 6-mm femur defect, which was stabilized with an external fixator that was converted into an internal device. in the development phase, the defect was filled with pmma in 16 rats to determine the most favorable timing for bone grafting. two rats were excluded since they died of anesthetic complications. the other 14 were successively euthanized after 2 weeks (n = 3), 4 weeks (n = 4), 6 weeks (n = 4), and 8 weeks (n = 3) for induced membrane analyses. in the validation phase, 12 rats underwent both stages of the procedure using a pmma spacer and were randomly assigned to two groups, whether the induced membrane was preserved or removed before grafting. to address our final objective, we implanted either polypropylene or pmma spacers into the defect (masquelet technique stage 1; n = 11 rats per group) for the period established by the development phase. in each group, 6 of 11 rats were euthanized to compare the biological properties of polypropylene-induced membranes and pmma-induced membranes using histological qualitative analysis, semiquantitative assessment of the bone morphogenic protein-2 content by immunostaining, and qualitative assessment of the mesenchymal stromal cell (msc; cd31-, cd45-, cd90+, and cd73+ phenotypes) content by flow cytometry. quantitative measurements from serum bone turnover markers were also performed. the five remaining rats of each group were used for masquelet technique stage 2, in which rat bone allografts were implanted in the induced membrane cavity after the polypropylene or pmma spacers were removed. these rats recovered for 10 weeks before being euthanized for microct quantitative measurements and bone histology qualitative assessment to evaluate and compare the extent of bone regeneration between groups.results: induced membrane analyses together with serum bone turnover measurements indicated that a 4-week interval time between stages was the most favorable. removal of the induced membrane before grafting led to almost constant early implant failures with poor bone formation. four-week-old rats with polypropylene-triggered induced membranes displayed similar histologic organization as rats with pmma-driven induced membranes, without any difference in the cell density of the extracellular matrix (4933 ? 916 cells per mm2 for polypropylene versus 4923 ? 1284 cells per mm2 for pmma; p = 0.98). induced membrane-derived mscs were found in both groups with no difference (4 of 5 with polypropylene versus 3 of 3 with pmma; p > 0.99). induced membrane bone morphogenic protein-2 immunolabeling and serum bone turnover marker levels were comparable between the polypropylene and pmma groups. microct analysis found that bone regeneration in the polypropylene group seemed comparable with that in the pmma group (29 ? 26 mm3 for polypropylene versus 24 ? 18 mm3 for pmma; p > 0.99). finally, qualitative histological assessment revealed a satisfactory endochondral ossification maturation in both groups.conclusion: using a critical-sized femoral defect model in rats, we demonstrated that polypropylene spacers could induce membrane encapsulation with histologic characteristics and bone regenerative capacities that seem like those of pmma spacers.clinical relevance: in a same bone site, polymers with close physical properties seem to lead to similar foreign body reactions and induce encapsulating membranes with comparable bone healing properties. polypropylene spacers made from disposable syringes could be a valuable alternative to pmma. these results support the possibility of a cementless masquelet technique in cases of pmma shortage caused by a lack of resources.   \n",

              "1  the masquelet technique : can disposable polypropylene syrinx be an alternative to standard pmma spacer ? a rat bone defect model . background : usually , the two - stage masquelet induce - membrane technique for extremity reconstruction begin with a polymethylmethacrylate ( pmma ) cement spacer - drive membrane , follow by an autologous cancellous bone graft implant into the membrane cavity to promote healing of large bone defect . in exceptional case , spacer make of polypropylene disposable syrinx be successfully use instead of the usual pmma spacer because of a pmma cement shortage cause by a lack of resource . however , this approach lack clinical evidence and require experimental validation before be recommend as an alternative to the conventional technique.questions/purpose : to ( 1 ) develop and ( 2 ) validate a critical - sized femoral defect model in rat for two stage of the masquelet technique and to ( 3 ) compare the biological and bone healing property of polypropylene - induce membrane and pmma - induce membrane in this model.method : fifty male sprague dawley rat age 8 week old receive a 6 - mm femur defect , which be stabilize with an external fixator that be convert into an internal device . in the development phase , the defect be fill with pmma in 16 rat to determine the most favorable timing for bone grafting . two rat be exclude since they die of anesthetic complication . the other 14 be successively euthanize after 2 week ( n = 3 ) , 4 week ( n = 4 ) , 6 week ( n = 4 ) , and 8 week ( n = 3 ) for induce membrane analysis . in the validation phase , 12 rat undergo both stage of the procedure use a pmma spacer and be randomly assign to two group , whether the induce membrane be preserve or remove before grafting . to address our final objective , we implant either polypropylene or pmma spacer into the defect ( masquelet technique stage 1 ; n = 11 rat per group ) for the period establish by the development phase . in each group , 6 of 11 rat be euthanized to compare the biological property of polypropylene - induce membrane and pmma - induce membrane use histological qualitative analysis , semiquantitative assessment of the bone morphogenic protein-2 content by immunostaine , and qualitative assessment of the mesenchymal stromal cell ( msc ; cd31- , cd45- , cd90 + , and cd73 + phenotype ) content by flow cytometry . quantitative measurement from serum bone turnover marker be also perform . the five remain rat of each group be use for masquelet technique stage 2 , in which rat bone allograft be implant in the induce membrane cavity after the polypropylene or pmma spacer be remove . these rat recover for 10 week before be euthanize for microct quantitative measurement and bone histology qualitative assessment to evaluate and compare the extent of bone regeneration between groups.result : induce membrane analyse together with serum bone turnover measurement indicate that a 4 - week interval time between stage be the most favorable . removal of the induce membrane before grafting lead to almost constant early implant failure with poor bone formation . four - week - old rat with polypropylene - trigger induce membrane display similar histologic organization as rat with pmma - drive induce membrane , without any difference in the cell density of the extracellular matrix ( 4933 ? 916 cell per mm2 for polypropylene versus 4923 ? 1284 cell per mm2 for pmma ; p = 0.98 ) . induce membrane - derive msc be find in both group with no difference ( 4 of 5 with polypropylene versus 3 of 3 with pmma ; p > 0.99 ) . induce membrane bone morphogenic protein-2 immunolabele and serum bone turnover marker level be comparable between the polypropylene and pmma group . microct analysis find that bone regeneration in the polypropylene group seem comparable with that in the pmma group ( 29 ? 26 mm3 for polypropylene versus 24 ? 18 mm3 for pmma ; p > 0.99 ) . finally , qualitative histological assessment reveal a satisfactory endochondral ossification maturation in both groups.conclusion : use a critical - sized femoral defect model in rat , we demonstrate that polypropylene spacer could induce membrane encapsulation with histologic characteristic and bone regenerative capacity that seem like those of pmma spacers.clinical relevance : in a same bone site , polymer with close physical property seem to lead to similar foreign body reaction and induce encapsulate membrane with comparable bone healing property . polypropylene spacer make from disposable syrinx could be a valuable alternative to pmma . these result support the possibility of a cementless masquelet technique in case of pmma shortage cause by a lack of resource .   \n",

              "      <td>Background: Usually, the two-stage Masquelet induced-membrane technique for extremity reconstruction begins with a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement spacer-driven membrane, followed by an autologous cancellous bone graft implanted into the membrane cavity to promote healing of large bone defects. In exceptional cases, spacers made of polypropylene disposable syringes were successfully used instead of the usual PMMA spacers because of a PMMA cement shortage caused by a lack of resources. However, this approach lacks clinical evidence and requires experimental validation before being recommended as an alternative to the conventional technique.Questions/purposes: To (1) develop and (2) validate a critical-sized femoral defect model in rats for two stages of the Masquelet technique and to (3) compare the biological and bone healing properties of polypropylene-induced membranes and PMMA-induced membranes in this model.Methods: Fifty male Sprague Dawley rats aged 8 weeks old received a 6-mm femur defect, which was stabilized with an external fixator that was converted into an internal device. In the development phase, the defect was filled with PMMA in 16 rats to determine the most favorable timing for bone grafting. Two rats were excluded since they died of anesthetic complications. The other 14 were successively euthanized after 2 weeks (n = 3), 4 weeks (n = 4), 6 weeks (n = 4), and 8 weeks (n = 3) for induced membrane analyses. In the validation phase, 12 rats underwent both stages of the procedure using a PMMA spacer and were randomly assigned to two groups, whether the induced membrane was preserved or removed before grafting. To address our final objective, we implanted either polypropylene or PMMA spacers into the defect (Masquelet technique Stage 1; n = 11 rats per group) for the period established by the development phase. In each group, 6 of 11 rats were euthanized to compare the biological properties of polypropylene-induced membranes and PMMA-induced membranes using histological qualitative analysis, semiquantitative assessment of the bone morphogenic protein-2 content by immunostaining, and qualitative assessment of the mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC; CD31-, CD45-, CD90+, and CD73+ phenotypes) content by flow cytometry. Quantitative measurements from serum bone turnover markers were also performed. The five remaining rats of each group were used for Masquelet technique Stage 2, in which rat bone allografts were implanted in the induced membrane cavity after the polypropylene or PMMA spacers were removed. These rats recovered for 10 weeks before being euthanized for microCT quantitative measurements and bone histology qualitative assessment to evaluate and compare the extent of bone regeneration between groups.Results: Induced membrane analyses together with serum bone turnover measurements indicated that a 4-week interval time between stages was the most favorable. Removal of the induced membrane before grafting led to almost constant early implant failures with poor bone formation. Four-week-old rats with polypropylene-triggered induced membranes displayed similar histologic organization as rats with PMMA-driven induced membranes, without any difference in the cell density of the extracellular matrix (4933 ? 916 cells per mm2 for polypropylene versus 4923 ? 1284 cells per mm2 for PMMA; p = 0.98). Induced membrane-derived MSCs were found in both groups with no difference (4 of 5 with polypropylene versus 3 of 3 with PMMA; p &gt; 0.99). Induced membrane bone morphogenic protein-2 immunolabeling and serum bone turnover marker levels were comparable between the polypropylene and PMMA groups. MicroCT analysis found that bone regeneration in the polypropylene group seemed comparable with that in the PMMA group (29 ? 26 mm3 for polypropylene versus 24 ? 18 mm3 for PMMA; p &gt; 0.99). Finally, qualitative histological assessment revealed a satisfactory endochondral ossification maturation in both groups.Conclusion: Using a critical-sized femoral defect model in rats, we demonstrated that polypropylene spacers could induce membrane encapsulation with histologic characteristics and bone regenerative capacities that seem like those of PMMA spacers.Clinical Relevance: In a same bone site, polymers with close physical properties seem to lead to similar foreign body reactions and induce encapsulating membranes with comparable bone healing properties. Polypropylene spacers made from disposable syringes could be a valuable alternative to PMMA. These results support the possibility of a cementless Masquelet technique in cases of PMMA shortage caused by a lack of resources.</td>\n",

However, the mechanism by which Oryeongsan (ORS) improves the impaired body fluid and salt metabolism is not clearly defined. The present study was performed to define the role of the cardiorenal humoral system in the ORS-induced changes in blood pressure and renal function in hypertension. Experiments were performed in normotensive and two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats. Changes in the fluid and salt balance were measured in rats individually housed in metabolic cages. Changes in the systemic and local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and cardiac natriuretic peptide hormone system (NPS) were evaluated. ORS water extract was administered by oral gavage (100 mg/kg daily) for 3 weeks. ORS induced diuresis and natriuresis along with an increase in glomerular filtration rate and downregulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) and aquaporin 2 expression in the renal cortex and medulla, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with ORS significantly decreased systolic blood pressure with contraction of body sodium and water accumulation in hypertensive rats. ORS-induced changes were accompanied by modulation of the RAS and NPS, downregulation of the systemic RAS and cardiorenal expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II subtype 1 (AT1) receptor, and upregulation of the plasma ANP concentration and cardiorenal expression of ANP, ACE2, Mas receptor, and AT2 receptor. These findings indicate that ORS induces beneficial effects on the high blood pressure through modulation of the RAS and NPS of the cardiorenal system, suppression of the prohypertensive ACE-AT1 receptor pathway and NHE3, accentuation of the antihypertensive ACE2-Mas axis/AT2 receptor pathway in the kidney, suppression of the systemic RAS, and elevation of the plasma ANP levels and its synthesis in the heart.

              "      <td>BACKGROUND: Sodium profiling improves haemodynamic tolerance in haemodialysis (HD) patients but may also influence sodium homeostasis. Changes in blood volume and plasma conductivity (PC) during HD can be modelled by feedback technology, but their effects on sodium homeostasis are not widely studied., METHODS: This randomized crossover study compared PC and ionic mass balance (IMB) as surrogate markers of sodium balance between standard HD [dialysate conductivity (DC) 14.0 mS/cm], sodium profiling (DC 15.0--&gt;14.0 mS/cm), blood volume (BV)-controlled and PC-controlled feedback (target: post-HD PC: 14.0 mS/cm) in 10 HD patients with frequent hypotension., RESULTS: 440 treatments were studied. Pre-dialytic PC was significantly higher during SP (14.4+/-0.2 mS/cm) compared to standard HD (14.2+/-0.3 mS/cm), and was not different between the other manoeuvres: PC-controlled (14.1+/-0.3 mS/cm), and BV-controlled feedback (14.2+/-0.2 mS/cm). Except for the first treatment, during which IMB was lower during the sodium profile, IMB did not differ significantly between the various manoeuvres and was strongly dependent upon ultrafiltration volume and the difference between pre-dialytic PC and DC. Symptomatic hypotensive episodes occurred least frequently during BV-controlled feedback (8%) compared to the other manoeuvres (standard HD, 16%; sodium profile, 14%; PC-controlled feedback, 17%), but differences were not significant. Inter-dialytic weight gain and pre-dialytic systolic blood pressure did not differ., CONCLUSIONS: Pre-dialytic PC increased during the sodium profile, and did not differ between BV- or PC-controlled feedback compared to standard HD. Thus, it appears that both BV- and PC-controlled feedback can be safely prescribed without substantial salt- and water-loading, at least in the short term.

              "      <td>the effect of sodium profiling and feedback technologies on plasma conductivity and ionic mass balance: a study in hypotension-prone dialysis patients. background: sodium profiling improves haemodynamic tolerance in haemodialysis (hd) patients but may also influence sodium homeostasis. changes in blood volume and plasma conductivity (pc) during hd can be modelled by feedback technology, but their effects on sodium homeostasis are not widely studied., methods: this randomized crossover study compared pc and ionic mass balance (imb) as surrogate markers of sodium balance between standard hd [dialysate conductivity (dc) 14.0 ms/cm], sodium profiling (dc 15.0--&gt;14.0 ms/cm), blood volume (bv)-controlled and pc-controlled feedback (target: post-hd pc: 14.0 ms/cm) in 10 hd patients with frequent hypotension., results: 440 treatments were studied. pre-dialytic pc was significantly higher during sp (14.4+/-0.2 ms/cm) compared to standard hd (14.2+/-0.3 ms/cm), and was not different between the other manoeuvres: pc-controlled (14.1+/-0.3 ms/cm), and bv-controlled feedback (14.2+/-0.2 ms/cm). except for the first treatment, during which imb was lower during the sodium profile, imb did not differ significantly between the various manoeuvres and was strongly dependent upon ultrafiltration volume and the difference between pre-dialytic pc and dc. symptomatic hypotensive episodes occurred least frequently during bv-controlled feedback (8%) compared to the other manoeuvres (standard hd, 16%; sodium profile, 14%; pc-controlled feedback, 17%), but differences were not significant. inter-dialytic weight gain and pre-dialytic systolic blood pressure did not differ., conclusions: pre-dialytic pc increased during the sodium profile, and did not differ between bv- or pc-controlled feedback compared to standard hd. thus, it appears that both bv- and pc-controlled feedback can be safely prescribed without substantial salt- and water-loading, at least in the short term. analysis of imb is useful to assess differences in sodium balance between single treatment sessions but appears of less value in a steady-state situation.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Epilepsy is a neurological disorder resulting from abnormal neuronal firing in the brain. Glutamate transporters and the glutamate-glutamine cycle play crucial roles in the development of seizures. In the present study, the correlation of epilepsy with glutamate transporters and enzymes was investigated. Herein, male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups (six animals/group); 35 mg/kg pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) was used to induce a kindling model of epilepsy. Once the kindling model was established, animals were treated for 15 days with either valproic acid (VPA, 350 mg/kg) or ceftriaxone (CEF, 200 mg/kg) in addition to the control group receiving saline. After treatment, electrocorticography (ECoG) was performed to record the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex. The glutamate reuptake time (T80) was also determined in situ using an in vivo voltammetry. The expression levels of glutamate transporters and enzymes in the M1 and CA3 areas of the brain were determined using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ECoG measurements showed that the mean spike number of the PTZ + VPA and PTZ + CEF groups was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than that of the PTZ group. Compared with the PTZ group, VPA or CEF treatment decreased the glutamate reuptake time (T80). The expression levels of EAAC1, GLT-1, GLAST, glutamine synthetase (GS), and glutaminase were increased in the PTZ group. Treatment with VPA or CEF enhanced the expression levels of GLT-1, GLAST, EAAC1, and GS, whereas the glutaminase expression level was reduced. The current results suggest that VPA or CEF decreases seizure activity by increasing glutamate reuptake by upregulating GLT-1 and GLAST expression, implying a possible mechanism for treating epilepsy. Also, we have suggested a novel mechanism for the antiepileptic activity of VPA via decreasing glutaminase expression levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the glutamate reuptake time in situ during the seizure (i.e., real-time measurement).Copyright ? 2021 John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia, Ltd.</td>\n",

The objective of this study was to better understand LARI injury patterns and outcomes.Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective review of the 2016 National Trauma Data Bank and used ICD-10 codes to identify patients injured by a large animal. The primary outcome was severe injury pattern, while secondary outcomes included mortality, hospital length of stay, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation usage.Results: There were 6,662 LARI included in our analysis. Most LARI (66%) occurred while riding the animal, and the most common type of LARI was fall from horse (63%). The median ISS was 9 and the most severe injuries (AIS ? 3) were to the chest (19%), head (10%), and lower extremities (10%). The overall mortality was low at 0.8%. Compared to non-riders, riders sustained more severe injuries to the chest (21% vs. 16%, p<0.001) and spine (4% vs. 2%, p<0.001). Compared to motor vehicle collisions (MVC), riders sustained fewer severe injuries to the head (10% vs. 12%, p<0.001) and lower extremity (10% vs. 12%, p=0.01). Compared to auto-pedestrian accidents, non-riders sustained fewer severe injuries to the head (11% vs. 19%, p<0.001) and lower extremity (10% vs. 20%, p<0.001).Conclusion: Patients involved in a LARI are moderately injured with more complex injuries occurring in the chest, head, and lower extremities. Fall from horse was the most common LARI mechanism. Overall mortality was low. Compared to non-riders, riders were more likely to sustain severe injuries to the chest and spine. Severe injury patterns were similar when comparing riders to MVC and, given that most LARI are riding injuries, we recommend trauma teams approach LARI as they would an MVC.\",\n          \"BACKGROUND: Metformin appears to improve reproductive function in some women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We wished to explore the effect of metformin in women with PCOS undergoing IVF., METHODS: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out between 2001 and 2004. Patients with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment using a long GnRH agonist protocol were randomized to receive metformin (MET), 850 mg, or placebo (PLA) tablets twice daily from the start of the down-regulation process until the day of oocyte collection. The primary outcome was to be an improvement in the overall fertilization rate., RESULTS: One-hundred and one IVF/ICSI cycles were randomized to receive metformin (52) or to receive placebo (49). There was no difference in the total dose of rFSH required per cycle (median dose: MET = 1200 U, PLA = 1300 U; P = 0.937). The median number of oocytes retrieved per cycle (MET = 17.2, PLA = 16.2; P = 0.459) and the overall fertilization rates (MET = 52.9%, PLA = 54.9%; P = 0.641) did not differ. However, both the clinical pregnancy rates beyond 12 weeks gestation per cycle (MET = 38.5%, PLA = 16.3%; P = 0.023) and per embryo transfer (MET = 44.4%, PLA = 19.1%; P = 0.022) were significantly higher in those treated with metformin. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the incidence of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was observed (MET = 3.8%, PLA = 20.4%; P = 0.023), and this was still significant after adjustment for BMI, total rFSH dose and age (OR = 0.15; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.76; P = 0.022)., CONCLUSION: Short-term co-treatment with metformin for patients with PCOS undergoing IVF/ICSI cycles does not improve the response to stimulation but significantly improves the pregnancy outcome and reduces the risk of OHSS.\",\n          \"BACKGROUND: Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) are non-digestible food ingredients that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. This study investigated the protective effect of the early-life GOS supplement on the piglets' gut function against the oxidative stress induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenge., METHODS: Eighteen neonatal piglets were assigned to three groups including CON, LPS and LPS + GOS groups. The piglets in CON group and LPS group received physiological saline, while those in LPS + GOS group received GOS solution for 13 d after birth. On d 14, the piglets in LPS group and LPS + GOS group were injected with LPS solutions, while the piglets in CON group were injected with the same volume of physiological saline., RESULTS: The results showed that the early-life GOS supplement blocked the LPS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) secretion, malondialdehyde (MDA) production and the increase of pro-apoptotic factor expression. Meanwhile, the early-life GOS supplement improved the activities of antioxidant enzymes, disaccharidase enzymes activities, and digestive enzymes activities, and increased the mRNA abundance of the gene related to nutrient digestion and absorption and the relative protein expression of tight junction. The study also showed that the early-life GOS supplement improved the expression of Hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H/quinone acceptor oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1), and activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that GOS enhanced the gut function, reduced the ROS production and pro-apoptotic factors gene expression, and activated the AMPK signaling pathway in LPS-challenged piglets.

(rsfmri)., methods: conventional mri, rsfmri and diffusion tensor imaging (dti) data was acquired from 10 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rrms) and 20 healthy controls. cross-correlation of the resting state average signal among the voxels in each brain region of the five cognitive networks: default mode network (dmn), attention, verbal memory, memory, and visuospatial working memory network, was calculated. voxelwise analyses were used to investigate fractional anisotropy (fa) of white matter tracts. the normalized gray matter (gm), white matter and

drugs has been shown to inhibit the formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts in vitro and to decrease bone resorption markers in vivo. these drugs also inhibit the expression of leptin in adipocytes. less leptin can be associated with higher bone mass, based on analyses of mice deficient in leptin action. effects of 1-year treatment with troglitazone, a member of the tzds, on bone mineral density (bmd) and bone metabolism were examined in 25 japanese type 2 diabetic patients. glucose metabolism was improved, whereas body mass index and percent body fat did not change throughout the study. the percent change of bmd was negatively correlated with that of serum leptin, whereas it was not associated with changes of bone metabolic markers, type i collagen n-telopeptide (ntx), bone alkaline phosphatase (alp), body mass index, or hba1c. serum leptin decreased in 68% of subjects (responders) after 1-month treatment and was consistently lower than the basal level throughout the treatment. percent changes of bmd were significantly higher in the responders than in the nonresponders and in nondiabetic subjects at 6 and 12 months. ntx and bone alp decreased at 1 month but increased thereafter in either group of patients. thus, it is suggested that the decrease in serum leptin with no reduction in body fat mass by troglitazone is associated with preventing bone loss in type 2
